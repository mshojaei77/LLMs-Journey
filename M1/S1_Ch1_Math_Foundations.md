# Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability Theory for Machine Learning: Foundational Mathematical Concepts

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are built upon the principles of machine learning, and at the heart of machine learning lies a strong foundation in mathematics. This chapter provides a concise overview of the essential mathematical concepts from Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability Theory that are crucial for understanding the inner workings of LLMs and machine learning algorithms in general.  This is not intended to be a rigorous mathematical treatise, but rather a focused introduction to the tools you'll need to grasp the concepts in this course.

Foundational mathematical concepts including linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory are needed for machine learning, especially for understanding large language models (LLMs).

**Linear Algebra:**
*   **Vectors and Tensors**: LLMs use continuous-valued vectors to represent words, processing text one word at a time. Understanding vectors and matrices is helpful when exploring the inner workings of LLMs. A gradient is a vector containing all of the partial derivatives of a multivariate function.
*   **Matrices**: A high school–level understanding of working with vectors and matrices can be helpful when exploring the inner workings of LLMs.
*   **Word Embeddings**: Converting data into a vector format is often referred to as embedding. Deep learning models cannot process raw text directly, therefore words need to be represented as continuous-valued vectors.

**Calculus:**
*   **Derivatives and Gradients**: Understanding derivatives is important. A gradient is a vector containing all of the partial derivatives of a multivariate function.
*   **Backpropagation**:  It is a crucial aspect of neural network training. PyTorch’s automatic differentiation engine enables convenient and efficient use of backpropagation. Backpropagation involves computing gradients of a loss function given the model’s parameters in a computation graph.
*   **Optimization**: Training LLMs involves a standard optimization process using gradient descent algorithms.

**Probability Theory:**
*   **Language Modeling**: The goal of language modeling is to predict the probability of a sequence of tokens occurring. The probability of a sequence can be defined using the chain rule.
*   **Maximum Likelihood Training**: The objective of maximum likelihood training is to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the training data.
*   **Probability Distribution**: The output of a model is a probability score for each token in the vocabulary. The method of choosing a single token from the probability distribution is called the decoding strategy.
*   **Softmax Function**: The Softmax function normalizes the input vector or matrix. The softmax function transforms the logits into probability scores.
