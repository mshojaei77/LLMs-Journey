# Module 16: Safety & Security

### Ethical Considerations in LLM Development
- **Description**: Address ethical implications and responsible practices in LLM development.
- **Concepts Covered**: `ethics`, `responsible AI`, `bias mitigation`, `fairness`, `content filtering`, `safety through reasoning`, `cultural bias`
- **Learning Resources**:
  - [China's AI Training Data Regulations](https://cac.gov.cn/2023-07/13/c_1690898327029107.htm) - Regulatory framework for model training data
  - [AI Ethics Guidelines](https://aiethicslab.com/resources/)
  - [Responsible AI Frameworks](https://www.ai-policy.org/)
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Safety mechanisms:
    - Training data filtering
    - Runtime content moderation
    - Safety through reasoning
  - Bias sources:
    - Training data bias
    - Cultural representation
    - Internet content skew
  - Challenges:
    - Prompt injection and bypass attempts
    - Cultural stereotyping in generative models
    - Balance between safety and utility

### Adversarial Attacks & Defenses
- **Description**: Understand and defend against adversarial attacks on language models.
- **Concepts Covered**: `adversarial attacks`, `robustness`, `input sanitization`, `defense mechanisms`
- **Learning Resources**:
  - [Adversarial Robustness in NLP](https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/)

  - [Adversarial Robustness Toolbox](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox)

### Content Filtering & Moderation
- **Description**: Implement content filtering and moderation to ensure safe and appropriate LLM outputs.
- **Concepts Covered**: `content filtering`, `moderation`, `toxicity detection`, `safety`, `model security`
- **Learning Resources**:
  - [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/)
  - [Content Moderation Best Practices](https://openai.com/policies/usage-guidelines)
  - [Understanding LLM Safety Bypasses](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/abliteration) - Technical analysis of safety mechanisms (⚠️ For research/educational purposes only)
  - [Best of N Jailbreaking Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02512) - Research on character-level perturbation attacks by Anthropic AI (⚠️ For research/educational purposes only)
  - [Abliteration Implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VYm3hOcvCpbGiqKZb141gJwjdmmCcVpR) - Technical demonstration (⚠️ For research/educational purposes only)
- **Tools**:
  - [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/)
  - [Hugging Face Detoxify](https://huggingface.co/unitary/toxic-bert)
- **Key Research Findings**:
  - Simple character-level perturbations can bypass safety measures
  - Attack Success Rates over 50% achieved with just 10k tries
  - Higher sampling temperature increases jailbreak success
  - Attacks are composable with other methods (roleplay, many-shot)
  - Circuit breaking shows promise in defense (40% vs 78% ASR)
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Implement robust safety measures to prevent bypass techniques
  - Regular security audits of model outputs
  - Monitor for potential misuse
  - Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and regulations
