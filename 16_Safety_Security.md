- **Key Research Findings**:
  - Simple character-level perturbations can bypass safety measures
  - Attack Success Rates over 50% achieved with just 10k tries
  - Higher sampling temperature increases jailbreak success
  - Attacks are composable with other methods (roleplay, many-shot)
  - Circuit breaking shows promise in defense (40% vs 78% ASR)
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Implement robust safety measures to prevent bypass techniques
  - Regular security audits of model outputs
  - Monitor for potential misuse
  - Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and regulations
